<p>There's a powerful set of <b>File Management</b> features accessible by opening the <b>Manage Files</b> control panel from the main app screen. You can send files to other apps that support Apple's Document Interchange. You can create new folders and rename/copy/move/delete existing files and folders. You can compress multiple files and folders into .zip archives, and you can uncompress .zip and .rar archives. You can also send files via e-mail from GoodReader. You can mark files as read/unread, set/remove a password protection for individual files/folders, set/remove a star and a color tag for a file or folder, create new PDF and TXT files for further editing and copy special URL links to clipboard to allow other application to easily launch GoodReader and open a particular file. You can import photos and videos from device's Photo Album, and export audio and video files to it. You can flatten PDF files with annotations, creating a non-editable version of your notes and drawings.</p>

<p>You can <b>sort files</b> in a file list view by name, size and date. Both sort orders are available - ascending and descending. On iPads use the <b>Sort</b> button at the top of the screen, On iPhones the <b>Sort</b> button is a part of Manage Files control panel.</p>

<h2>Find Files</h2>
<p>
	Although it's not the part of Manage Files control panel, we thought that we still should mention this feature here. Use it to quickly locate files and folders in one of four modes - by a file name match, recently read, recently added, starred. You can access this feature by opening one of the file search control panel on iPad (<b>Find</b>, <b>Recents</b>, <b>Starred</b>) or by pressing this button in the main file list view of iPhone:<br>
	<img src="/HTML/HTMLbtnFind-mainScreen.png" border="0" width="50">
</p>
<p>Once a file is found, you can tap on it to open it. If you don't want to open a found file, but only want to locate it, tap on the arrow next to the found file's name.</p>
<p>You can change the meaning or the word <b>recently</b> when finding files in <b>recently read</b> and <b>recently added</b> modes. This is done in Application Settings, General section. Possible values are: 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month.</p>

<h2>Tips for Managing Files and Sending E-mail using Manage Files control panel</h2>
<ul>
	<li>press <b>Done</b> (iPad) or <b>Manage Files</b> (iPhone, at the top of the screen) button to exit the file managing mode</li>
	<li>iPhone: swipe Manage Files panel to the sides to see the action buttons that are currently hidden</li>
	<li>most of File Management actions require selecting files/folders. Select or deselect files/folders by tapping them. <b>Select All</b> and <b>Deselect All</b> buttons are there to help you with this. Selected files are marked with a green dot.</li>
	<li>a quick way to select a single file/folder while in normal file browsing mode and enter the File Management mode is to tap a special &quot;tools&quot; mini-button found nearby each file or folder</li>
	<li id="openin">use <b>Open In...</b> button to open a selected file in another app that supports Document Interchange</li>
	<li>use <b>New Folder</b> button to create a new folder</li>
	<li>use <b>Delete</b> button to delete all selected files/folders (be careful - this can't be undone)</li>
	<li>use <b>Rename</b> button to rename a single selected file or folder. Our &quot;Smart Rename&quot; feature hides a filename extension, but still allows you to change it if necessary.</li>
	<li>use <b>Copy</b> and <b>Move</b> buttons to copy or move selected files/folders</li>
	<li>use <b>Zip</b> button to compress multiple files and folders into .zip archives. If any protected item was put into archive, this archive will also be protected.</li>
	<li>use <b>Unzip</b> and <b>Unrar</b> buttons to uncompress existing .zip and .rar archives</li>
	<li>use <b>E-Mail</b> button to send selected files as e-mail attachments. Folders can't be e-mailed (but you can zip them first). Your outgoing mail server may provide a limitation for a total size of files that can be sent in a single message.</li>
	<li>use <b>New PDF</b> button to create a blank PDF file for your notes and drawings</li>
	<li>use <b>New TXT</b> button to create a new empty TXT file for further editing. This feature is useful for comfortable offline reading or editing of a pure text copied from some other app (Safari, for example).</li>
	<li>use <b>MarkRead</b> and <b>MarkUnread</b> buttons to mark files and folders as read or unread. Read and unread files are distinguished by title's color - read files are shown in black, unread - in blue. Opening a file for reading or visiting a folder in normal (non-action) mode automatically marks it as read. You can see the list of recently read files using <b>Find Files</b> feature in <b>Recently Read</b> mode.</li>
	<li id="star">use <b>Star</b> and <b>Unstar</b> buttons to visually mark/unmark files and folders with a star and a color tag. To toggle a star for a single file or folder you can simply tap the star icon in file management mode. You can quickly see the list of all starred files and folders using <b>Find Files</b> feature in <b>Starred</b> mode.</li>
	<li id="protect">use <b>Protect</b> and <b>Unprotect</b> buttons to set/remove password protection for individual files and folders. When trying to open protected files or folders you will be asked to enter a password (it must be previously set in Application Settings, Security section). All protected files and folders share the same password, but this password is different from application startup password. Once you enter this password, GoodReader enters the <b>private</b> mode. It means that you can freely open protected files and folders until you quit GoodReader. You can see a small lock icon on the bottom bar when you're in the private mode. The contents of protected folders is accessible via WiFi and via Find Files feature only if you're in the private mode. Also you're not allowed to copy or move protected files and folders that contain protected files, if you're not in the private mode. This feature uses iOS's Data Protection API, which actually <b>encrypts</b> your files, keeping your data confidential, even if your device gets lost or stolen. However, there are <b>special procedures</b> to perform, and also there are some <b>limitations</b>. Please be <b>absolutely</b> sure to read the <a href="gr-man-general.html#dataprot">Data Protection manual</a>, if you want to actually encrypt your files. Be careful not to forget your password, because no way of retrieving or resetting this password is provided. However, if you have forgotten your password, the only way to reset it is to delete and reinstall the app, which will also erase all your files and settings. Latest iPhone and iPad models also allow the use of Touch ID to unlock GoodReader's data with a fingerprint (this feature needs to be explicitly enabled in app settings).</li>
	<li>use <b>Flatten Copy</b> button to <a href="gr-man-view-pdf.html#flatten">flatten a PDF file with annotations</a></li>
	<li>use <b>Import Photos</b> and <b>Save to Photos</b> buttons to transfer audio and video files between GoodReader and device's Photo Album</li>
	<li id="link">use <b>Link</b> button to copy a special URL link of a single selected file to clipboard. This URL link will have a special prefix <b>gropen://</b> and will contain a full internal path to a selected file inside GoodReader's file storage. Any other iOS app that is capable of opening URL links (for example, todo-type or notebook-type app) can use this URL link to automatically launch GoodReader and open a file being linked. For example, you can create a &quot;Read this book&quot; todo task in a todo application and associate an URL link with this task in such a way that tapping this URL link in that other application will launch GoodReader and open this file of interest. If you invoke the <b>Link</b> action with several selected files, several URL links separated by line-breaks will be copied to clipboard.</li>
	<li>&quot;iCloud&quot; folder: use <b>Download</b> button to start downloading files and entire folders from iCloud. Once a file is downloaded, all changes to this file made elsewhere will be automatically pushed to the current device.</li>
	<li>&quot;iCloud&quot; folder: use <b>Evict</b> button to evict files and entire folders from the current device. Changes made to evicted files elsewhere will not be pushed to the current device. To resume receiving changes to a file, you will have to download it again. You may want to evict certain files to save Internet traffic while you're on the go.</li>
	<li>&quot;iCloud&quot; folder: use <b>Publish</b> button to create a public web link to share an iCloud file with other people. Publishing a file creates its snapshot. This snapshot is not affected by any subsequent changes made to the original file.</li>
</ul>
