This will make them visible in all PDF-capable apps (including Mail and Safari), regardless of those apps' inability to display PDF annotations. This also makes your annotations non-editable, which may be useful if you want to prevent your notes and drawings from being altered by someone else. &quot;Flatten&quot; option is also available when sending files from GoodReader via EMail or via &quot;Open In...&quot; menu.

												<p>By popular demand, the switch that allows to choose between new and old <b>PDF displaying engines</b> is available in Settings. Switch back to the original GoodReader PDF engine if for some reason the new one doesn't work for you.</p>
												<p>Introducing <b>Higher quality images</b> switch in Settings for PDF files. If you updated to iOS 4.2, you could have noticed a degraded quality of scanned images in PDF files. This is due to a new way of iOS handling PDF images. &quot;Higher quality images&quot; switch is there to bring the original scans quality back. However, it impacts rendering performance noticeably. So try this switch to see which option suits your needs better.</p>
												<p>Other new features:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>wireless printing: <b>AirPrint</b> support (iOS 4.2 or later)</li>
													<li>actions available without closing a file - &quot;Open In...&quot;, E-Mail, Print</li>
													<li>PDF Night Mode brightness slider is now available directly in a viewer, no need to adjust it in Settings any more</li>
													<li>PDF Annotations: adjustable <b>line thickness</b> for drawings</li>
													<li>PDF Annotations: adjustable <b>opacity</b> for drawings</li>
													<li>PDF Annotations: popup text notes are now visible on an external VGA display</li>
													<li>images can now be deleted without closing the image viewer</li>
												</ul>
												<p>Bug fixes:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>fixed the PDF Night Mode flickering bug</li>
													<li>fixed the bug that sometimes turned PDF pages into black</li>
													<li>fixed the issue with crashing in freehand drawing mode</li>

												<p>Major update introducing major new feature - <b>PDF Annotations</b>, including <b>notes</b>, <b>highlights</b>, <b>markups</b> and <b>drawings</b> (iOS 3.2 or later):</p>
												<ul>
													<li>all annotations that you create or edit in GoodReader - notes, highlights, markups, and drawings - are <b>saved in a PDF file</b>, so you will be able to see them later on a computer or in another copy of GoodReader on your colleague's device</li>
													<li>all notes, highlights, markups, and drawings created <b>outside</b> GoodReader, and properly stored in a PDF file, can be viewed or edited in GoodReader</li>
													<li>types of annotations that you can <b>create and edit</b> in GoodReader: comments (&quot;sticky notes&quot;) with 7 different icons, text highlights, freehand drawings, lines, arrows, rectangles, ovals, text underlines, text deletion marks (strikeouts), text insertion marks, text replacement marks. You can freely adjust color of all of the above.</li>
													<li>other types of annotations that you can <b>view</b> in GoodReader: text boxes with callouts, polygons and polylines, &quot;squiggly&quot; underlines, &quot;cloudy&quot; shapes, rubber stamps, file attachments. All annotations that can be <b>viewed</b>, can also be <b>deleted</b>. In addition, some of them can be edited in a limited fashion (color, placement, scale).</li>
													<li>you can now <b>extract files</b> from PDF file attachments</li>
													<li>two main gestures that you should use to work with annotations - <b>single tap</b>, and <b>tap &amp; hold</b>. Depending on where you tap (on a text, on an existing annotation, or on a free space on a page), different menus will be presented to you.</li>
												</ul>
												<p>Other important improvements and new features:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>now you can <b>select text</b> directly on a PDF page. Tap on a text and hold your finger for a while. You can then <b>copy</b> it to the clipboard, or create <b>markups</b> for it (highlights, underlines, strikeouts, etc.)</li>
													<li>certain not very large files were known to consistently crash GoodReader (as well as other PDF reader apps) for no apparent reason. This was the issue with iOS 3.x. We have resolved this issue. It shouldn't be a problem now, even if you're still on iOS 3.x.</li>
													<li>now we can hide <b>PDF watermarks</b> (adjustable option in settings)</li>
													<li>certain <b>button images</b> in place of PDF links that were not shown before, are now shown correctly</li>
												</ul>
												<p>And some other nice things:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>you can now choose which minimum zoom ratio you prefer for PDF pages - <b>fit to screen</b> or <b>fit to width</b> (an option in settings)</li>
													<li>we have lifted the limitation for a size of files being extracted from <b>PDF Portfolios</b>. Now we're able to extract files of any size. Just make sure that you have enough of free disk space!</li>
													<li>now when you copy a file to the same location as the original, a copy is created. Very handy if you want to annotate a PDF file, but also want to leave the original file unchanged.</li>
													<li>a workaround for the issue when WiFi was conflicting with Bluetooth (slow WiFi connection, occasional WiFi signal drops when Bluetooth switch is on, etc.) was finally found. Now there should be no conflict between WiFi and Bluetooth when working in GoodReader.</li>
